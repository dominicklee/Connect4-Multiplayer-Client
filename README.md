# Connect4-Multiplayer

### By Lewis W. Miller and Noah P. G. Stride

## C4
Lewis' implementation of the client. This version provides both an offline and online gameplay functionality, as well as some sweet A.F. music (Ctrl-M in the *GamePeruser* screen)

#### Features
1. Offline Play

Traditional Connect 4 for the less internettedly-inclined
> - Vs Human or Vs AI*
> - Multiple theme choices
> - Ability to choose which player goes first
>   - Not available Vs AI

2. Online Play

Experience the true meaning of C4 using the full power of the internet and the Nightmarlin Server
> - Vs random internetters
> - Themes work here too
> - WebChat functionality
> - Is all good fun and games

3. Dedicated help page

Not sure where to start? Just press F1 on any game screen for as much help as you might want.
If that doesn't work, then [Discord](https://discord.gg/j9Z3Qc7) might.

## SHyTY 4
Lovingly named, nicely implemented. SHyTY 4 is Noah's ~~abomination~~ creation that plays nicely with our favourite thing: Servers

#### Features
1.  Online Play
> - Vs random interwebz users
> - Play made possible by our finest servers
> - Chatting with strangers might be dangerous, but it's also pretty gosh-darn fun


## C4-Server

Our pride and joy is a small amount of JavaScript that holds everything together, the main Connect 4 Server. While it may not look like much, it uses algorithms and coding to get the job done

#### Features
*C4* and *SHyTY 4* online gameplay hosting. End of.
